This is my first SpringMVC project.
It is a simulation of a simple library databases where stored info about books and people.It database structure has 2 relationed tables(Person,Book).The web page
can show all people who registered in the library and show books that now they have also you can edit person info ,delete person from db or even create new.
Book page works similar except you can give this book to another person by choosing the person from drop list,if someone already has this book there will be person info despite drop list.
Program has all needed classes and also validation of inputed information.
Program was excecuted with Tomcat server(local)
Connected database:PostgreSQL(local)
